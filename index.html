        <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Why We Should Prevent World War 3</h2>
        <p class="animate-on-scroll">World War 3 would have devastating consequences for humanity, the environment, and the global economy. Here's why it's crucial to stop it from happening:</p>
        <ul class="animate-on-scroll">
            <li><strong style="color: red">Humanitarian Impact:</strong> A global conflict would lead to immense loss of life, displacement of populations, and widespread suffering. The human cost of such a war is incalculable.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: red">Environmental Destruction:</strong> Modern warfare involves destructive weapons that can cause long-term damage to our planet. Nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons pose severe risks to the environment, affecting air, water, and soil quality.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: red">Economic Collapse:</strong> A global war would disrupt international trade, cause financial instability, and lead to a recession or depression. The global economy, already interconnected, would suffer massive setbacks.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: red">Technological Regression:</strong> Conflict diverts resources away from scientific research and technological advancement. Instead of progressing, humanity would face setbacks in innovation and development.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: red">Global Instability:</strong> War creates a cycle of violence and instability, making it harder to achieve lasting peace. Preventing World War 3 is crucial for maintaining global stability and fostering cooperation among nations.</li>
        </ul>
